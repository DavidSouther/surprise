# Surprise! Best Sellers! 

Peruse the NYTimes Best Sellers list! Once a week, whenever there's a new best seller, we'll order it from Amazon to your Kindle or doorstep!

## Documentation
After cloning the repository, install dependencies with `bower install ; npm install`. You might need to `mv components vendors` if bower keeps being shitty. Make sure [grunt-cli] is installed (`npm i -g grunt-cli`), and run grunt to get a complete build. Start the server with `npm start`. Open a browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). 

### Configuration
Configuration options are set in `config.json`. To override defaults, create a file in the root of the project called `config.json` and add a JSON object with the overridden keys and values.

*Options*
- _port_ network port to listen on. Default `3000`

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Conduct development in a branch, and submit a pull request with single features and bugs. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Build your code using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

_Also, please don't edit files in the "lib" subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!_
